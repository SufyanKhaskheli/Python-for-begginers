#use hashtags  to enter comments
#to create a multi line comment use triple quotes:
"""
adgsdghsfhfjsdfgsdfgsdg
"""
print("sufyan",end=" ")
print("like the video")
#if you want the output to not go in new line we use : , end=""
#this end is called new line character

#if you want to write one print statement which encompasses and outputs both the two just write print("statement1","statement2",end" ").
#if you use comma in between the two different statemments it will outpuput you with space in between two sentences

print("c:\narry")
print("c:\\narry")#in this case it will print with single slash
#when you use \n ,single fwd slash  this is escape command i.e \n will complete n first.
print("\'C:")#will print with single quote

#Escape commands:
print ("sufyan is \n good boy \t haha") #t1 presents us with a tab \n presents us with a new line
#for more escape commands go to google and check it out
